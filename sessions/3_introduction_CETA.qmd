# 1. Introduction {background-color="#FE400"}

## About Cyclical Ecological Trajectory Analysis

**Aims and domain of application**

**Cyclical Ecological Trajectory Analysis (CETA)** is an extension of the ETA framework to analyze cyclical ecological dynamics (seasons, day/night cycles...) described in Djeghri et al (2026)^[Djeghri N, Sturbois A, Hélaouët P, Geissmann Q, Rimmelin-Maury P, Boyé A, Gauthier O, De Cáceres M (2026). Going round in cycles but going somewhere: Deciphering cyclical dynamics using Ecological Trajectory Analysis. Ecological Monographs.]

. . .

**Rationale and general approach**

 + CETA proceeds by sub-setting trajectories presenting cyclical dynamics into sub-trajectories of interest (Cycles, and fixed date trajectories).

 + CETA trajectories can then be described and compared as is done for other, non-CETA, trajectories.
 
 + Cycles specific geometries sometimes necessitate using dedicated metrics.

 + CETA also allows computing **Cyclical Shifts**, a multidimensional equivalent of the notion of phenological advances and delays.

. . .

**Software**

CETA is readily implemented within the **ecotraj** package (from version 1.0.0)

. . .

**Package call**
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(ecotraj)
```

# 2. CETA-specific conceptual and geometric elements {background-color="#00B1ED"}

## Conceptual and geometric elements

The most important elements of CETA are:


| Element   | Notation | Description                                                  |
|-------------------|--|---------------------------------------------------|
| *Cyclical trajectory* | $T$ | A cyclical trajectory is a trajectory presenting (or expected to present) cyclical dynamics.  |
| *Time* | $t$ | The position of a given ecological observation in a linear temporal axis (i.e. ‘when’ the assessment act occurred).  |
| *Date* | $đ$ | The position of a given ecological observation in a cyclical (or recurrent) temporal axis (e.g. a day of the year).  |
| *Cycle duration*  | $DUR_C$ | The ecological entity whose dynamics are of interest. It can be an individual, a population, a community or an entire ecosystem  |


. . .


Together these elements allow defining CETA-specific trajectories:

| Trajectory   | Notation | Description                                                  |
|-------------------|--|---------------------------------------------------|
| *Cycles* | $C$ | A Cycle is a special-case of trajectory section obtained from $T$ of duration $DUR_C$.  |
| *Fixed date trajectories* | $fdT$ | Fixed date trajectories are the trajectories joining the ecological state of the same date $đ$ in a given cyclical trajectory.  |

## Defining some toy CETA trajectories

Start by defining one cyclical trajectory with three cycles:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
times <- 0:30 #The sampling times of the time series
DurC <- 10 #The duration of the cycles (i.e. the periodicity of the time series)
dates <- times%%DurC #The dates associated to each times
site <- rep(c("A"),length(times)) #The sites associated to each times (only one)
trend <- 0.05 #A trend that will be applied to the cycles to make it more interesting
noise <- 0.05 #A noise term to make things less perfect

#Make cyclical data
x <- sin((times*2*pi)/DurC)+trend*times+rnorm(length(times),mean=0,sd=noise)
y <- cos((times*2*pi)/DurC)+rnorm(length(times),mean=0,sd=noise)
mat <- cbind(x,y)

#Express it as a distance matrix
dmat <- dist(mat)

#Finally make it a trajectory object:
x <- defineTrajectories(dmat, sites = site, times = times)
```

## Visualization of the cylical trajectory

```{r pcoa, echo = TRUE, fig = TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align = "center"}
trajectoryPCoA(x,lwd = 2,length = 0.2)
```

## Extracting and visualizing the cycles...

Extraction of cycles...
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
cycle <- extractCycles(x,cycleDuration = DurC)
```


. . .

...and visualization
```{r pcoaCycles, echo = TRUE, fig = TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align = "center"}
cyclePCoA(cycle,lwd = 2,length = 0.2)
```

::: footer
2.  CETA-specific conceptual and geometric elements

## ...and the fixed date trajectories

Extraction of fixed date trajectories...
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
fdtraj <- extractFixedDateTrajectories(x,
                                       cycleDuration = DurC,
                                       namesFixedDate = paste0("Date_",1:10))
```


. . .


...and visualization
```{r pcoafdT, echo = TRUE, fig = TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.align = "center"}
fixedDateTrajectoryPCoA(fdtraj,lwd = 2,length = 0.2)
```

## Object structure

Note that the structure of the **ecotraj/CETA** objects is very similar to what you already know.
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
names(cycle)
names(fdtraj)
```

. . .


But cycles have some specificities
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
head(cycle$metadata)
head(fdtraj$metadata)
```

. . .

We won't get into the detail now but you can check the [CETA vignette](https://emf-creaf.github.io/ecotraj/articles/IntroductionCETA.html) for more details.

# 3. Characterizing and comparing CETA trajectories {background-color="#00B1ED"}

## Metrics for cycles

Cycle have particular geometries (they loop back on themselves) implying that some classical ETA metrics are not adapted and must be changed.

. . .

Directionality is replaced by convexity expressed as: $CONV(C) = 360/\Sigma \theta$ with $\theta$ the turning angle at each ecological state of cycle $C$.

. . .

Note that $\theta$ can be defined by ecological states outside the cycle of interest. This is why the **ecotraj** implementation uses the cyclical trajectory instead of the cycles:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
cycleConvexity(x,DurC)#Note: the function takes x instead of cycle as input
```
. . .

::: callout-note
The function for the first cycle returns $NA$, this is expected but can you find why?
:::

. . .


**ecotraj** has a function dedicated to obtain multiple summary metrics for cycles:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
cycleMetrics(x,DurC)#Again, the function takes x instead of cycle as input
```

## Metrics for fixed date trajectories

Fixed trajectories are regular trajectories and can be studied with classical **ecotraj** functions:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
trajectoryMetrics(fdtraj)
```

# 4. Cyclical shifts {background-color="#00B1ED"}

## Computing cyclical shifts

A last, and perhaps important aspect of CETA are cyclical shifts. They can be understood as multidimensional analogues of the phenological concept of advances and delays.

. . .

The function **cycleShifts** will compute by default all possible cyclical shifts in a given cyclical trajectory:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
cycleShifts(x,DurC)#Note that, again, we give x as input.
```
